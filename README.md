# Backend Engineering with FastAPI & Cloud Deployment ⚡

This repository contains the technical development and API architecture built during the advanced course. The focus was on creating robust, secure, and production-ready backend systems.

## 🎯 Project Focus
Building high-performance backend services that are not only data-efficient but also scalable through containerization and cloud services (AWS), integrating industry-standard security layers.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL & SQL (SQLAlchemy ORM)
* **Security:** OAuth2 Authentication and JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
* **DevOps & Deployment:** Docker (Containerization) and AWS
* **Testing:** Automated API testing to ensure application reliability.

## 🧠 Skills Acquired
* **API Design:** Developing RESTful endpoints with automatic data validation (Pydantic).
* **Data Management:** Relational database modeling and query optimization in PostgreSQL.
* **Industry-Grade Security:** Implementing secure login flows and route protection.
* **Modern Infrastructure:** Packaging applications into Docker images to ensure portability across environments.
* **Cloud Readiness:** Deployment strategies on AWS for scalable web services.

## 📁 Repository Structure
* `/app`: API source code (routers, schemas, models).
* `/tests`: Automated testing suite.
* `Dockerfile`: Container configuration for deployment.
* `docker-compose.yml`: Service orchestration (API + Database).
